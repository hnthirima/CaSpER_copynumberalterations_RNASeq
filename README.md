# Calling Copy Number Alterations (CNA) using RNA-Seq and CaSpER
This repository contains code used to call copy number alterations in meningioma samples using RNA-Seq data.

CaSpER is published in Nature Communications: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13779-x

See forked akdess/CaSpER repository for tutorials and more information on analysis. 


Data files required for the analysis:
1. Normalized RNA-Seq count file (test samples and control samples)
2. Cytoband information (cytoBand_hg38_ucsc.txt)
3. Centromere information (centromere_hg38.txt)
